APP DEVELOPMENT IN PROGRESS
This app is dedicated to manage shooting range competitions.
The main aim was to do app using advanced concepts.
It utilizes various technologies like:
- Flask
- Celery
- Keycloak
- API
- Postgres DB
- Docker

TODOS:
- implement Postgres DB
- add admin usertype to keycloak
- code refactor

App needs to have admin user created to work properly.
This account should be created from Keycloak UI panel immediately after first launch.
